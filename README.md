# About
This project uses AI Reinforcement Learning to navigate through a maze. The maze is constructed by a 8x8 multi-dimensional array with 1's representing immovable blocks and 0's representing empty spaces. The goal of the AI is to navigate from the starting point, the top left block of the maze, to the ending point, the bottom right block of the maze. Once the simulation is completed, the maze along with the actions taken by the AI are plotted in a single plot that represents the model generated from the simulation. This final plot is what is shown in the image above.
